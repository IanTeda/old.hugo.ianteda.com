      <description>On the subject of money,
Keep in mind that money is a lot like religion, politics and health. People believe they have the one truth and they will defend it passionately. But there are many paths, you need to find the one that best fits your character, appetite for risk and time.</description>

      <description>On the subject of character,
The best index to a person&amp;#39;s character is how he treats people who can&amp;#39;t do him any good, and how he treats people who can&amp;#39;t fight back.
Abigail Van Buren  Your character is essentially what you do, your actions. And your actions are largely a result of your habits.</description>

Real difficulties can be overcome; it is only the imaginary ones that are unconquerable.

      <description>Your beliefs become your thoughts; Your thoughts become your words; Your words become your actions; Your actions become your habits; Your habits become your values; Your values become your destiny.
Mahatma Ghandi.  It is our habits that control our actions, and it is our actions that define our character.</description>

      <description>A habit is something you can do without thinking — which is why most of us have so many of them.
Frank A. Clark.  We are, for the most part a collection of habits. A collection of emotional, physical and intellectual habits, systematically organised for our brains optimisation.</description>

      <description>Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
George Bernhard Shaw  Life isn&amp;rsquo;t something you chip away at until you find your passion waiting inside. Life is something you build upon slowly over time, it is something you create1. So instead of discovering yourself, create yourself.</description>

      <description>Man seeks for himself a simplified and lucid image of the world.
Albert Einstein  Mental models simplify the world around us so we can make sense of our surroundings. They are an abstraction of reality, a simplification of an incomprehensibly world so our limited cognitive capabilities can process all our inputs without overload.</description>

      <title>The Bold Mistake Instruction</title>
      <link>https://ianteda.com/blogs/the-bold-mistake-instruction/</link>

      <description>All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it&amp;#39;s impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.
Chapter III: Of Mixed Princedoms   Life is risk, it cannot be avoided so do not let the possibility of being wrong prevent action.</description>

Know who you are and remember were you came from, but always look forward to were you are going.
