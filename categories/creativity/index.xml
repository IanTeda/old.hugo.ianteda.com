      <description>Forward Money is a lot like religion and politics, in that everyone believes they have the one truth. This makes for passionate conversations, but should not mean we avoid talking about or getting involved in investing, money and good money management.
There are many paths to financial freedom, you need to find the one that works for you.</description>

      <description>A pull up should be thought of as a row. Making the row a great supporting exercise for the pull up.

      <description>Great overall trunk workout. Using a lot of the same body movements as the squat.
I use them as volume/metabolic building workout to compliment the squat.

      <description>If you are only going to do one exercise, make sure it is the squat. It maybe the most important exercise in the weight room. But is one of the least utilised, because it is the most misunderstood. It involves a complex full range of motion.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have a bench to press from, so I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing push ups as my primary push exercise. You will also find that the bench press is becoming less of bench mark for strength &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;how much can you bench bro&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>In life you will not find yourself having to do movements similar to the curl very often. And so, the curl doesn&amp;rsquo;t add much to your over body strength. But who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to have bigger guns. So we all do them.

      <guid>https://ianteda.com/blogs/the-push-up/</guid>
      <description>Push ups are similar to the bench press, using similar upper body muscles. They have the advantage of using more muscle mass and joints then the bench press. But have the the disadvantage of being harder to progress &amp;ndash; i.e. add weight.
Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a bench to press from.</description>

      <description>My aim is to workout tomorrow. So I need to workout today in such a way, that tomorrow I am not to sore. This for the most part means not going to failure. But finding the balance between volume and intensity.
Starting out I have found that five sets of five reps has served me well to build up my base strength.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently follow the below workout split. Cycling through a different workout each morning. With around only 40-50 minutes each morning I do what I can. Avoiding stretching and other time wasters. And fitting in metabolic conditioning over lunch when I have a slot or a commute to work.</description>

      <description>Fitness is a lot like religion, politics and money. Everybody believes they have the one true, because it has worked for them. However the truth is, you need to find the path that works for you. This means setting goals, experimenting, measuring outcomes, adapting and moving towards your goals each day.</description>

      <description>On the subject of money,
Keep in mind that money is a lot like religion, politics and health. People believe they have the one truth and they will defend it passionately. But there are many paths, you need to find the one that best fits your character, appetite for risk and time.</description>

      <description>On the subject of character,
The best index to a person&amp;#39;s character is how he treats people who can&amp;#39;t do him any good, and how he treats people who can&amp;#39;t fight back.
Abigail Van Buren  Your character is essentially what you do, your actions. And your actions are largely a result of your habits.</description>

      <description>A habit is something you can do without thinking — which is why most of us have so many of them.

      <description>Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
George Bernhard Shaw  Life isn&amp;rsquo;t something you chip away at until you find your passion waiting inside. Life is something you build upon slowly over time, it is something you create1. So instead of discovering yourself, create yourself.</description>

      <description>Man seeks for himself a simplified and lucid image of the world.
Albert Einstein  Mental models simplify the world around us so we can make sense of our surroundings. They are an abstraction of reality, a simplification of an incomprehensibly world so our limited cognitive capabilities can process all our inputs without overload.</description>

      <description>All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it&amp;#39;s impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.
Chapter III: Of Mixed Princedoms   Life is risk, it cannot be avoided so do not let the possibility of being wrong prevent action.</description>
