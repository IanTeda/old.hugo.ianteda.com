      <description>With great power comes great responsibility.— Uncle Ben
 Collections of information get abstracted away into what we call professions. Doctors, lawyers, electricians, engineers, etc. It isn’t possible for each of us to know everything, so we rely on professions. And we rely on professionals to understand that information. Being a professional is about being a trustee of information.
We rely on professionals to grow and to peer review there field of information.</description>

      <title>Rule 15 - We Are All Paid To Think</title>

      <description>Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it.&amp;ndash; Henry Ford
 Back in the day, when I was going through University I worked as a labourer from time to time for a good friend of mine Cam. Cam ran his own building company and I did occasional work when business was busy or an extra pair of hands was needed to hold a nail.</description>

      <description>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.&amp;ndash; Leonardo da Vinci
 Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS).
It isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to make things difficult, anybody can do that. Even someone stupid. The skill and art, is in making it simple.
Simple is: the essence; the most important part; something that is repeatable; provides the same outcome; that if you remember anything, remember this;
The KISS principle was first adopted by the US Navy1, for the design of their naval ships.</description>

      <title>Rule 13 - Learn to ask good questions.</title>
      <link>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-13-good-questions/</link>

      <description>Successful people ask better questions, and as a result, they get better answers.&amp;ndash; Tony Robbins
 Questions are the cornerstone of communication &amp;ndash; aka leadership, problem solving and learning. So being able to ask good questions is the key to good communication, efficient problem solving and effective learning.
There is an art to asking a good questions, because after all if you put garbage in you get garbage out.</description>

      <title>Rule 12 - When you have the choice, always start with the hardest part.</title>
      <link>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-12-hard-things/</link>

      <description>Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same.The Fray - All at Once
 Anything worthwhile is hard. Because it is the difficulties that make it unique and it is the uniqueness that makes it valuable.
 Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations. - Unknown
 When you have the choice, always start with the hardest part first. By achieving the hardest part first you gain a strategic and physiological advantage.</description>

      <title>Rule 11 - Finding Time</title>
      <link>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-11-finding-time/</link>

      <guid>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-11-finding-time/</guid>
      <description>Time is the measurer of all things, but is itself immeasurable, and the grand discloser of all things, but is itself undisclosed.  - Charles Caleb Colton
 It all boils down to time. After all, money is just the value we place on time. It makes sense then, that the most valuable gift you can give is your time. Because, we don&amp;rsquo;t know how much we have, we cannot make more of it and once it has turned into yesterday we cannot get it back.</description>

      <description>You don&amp;rsquo;t know, what you don&amp;rsquo;t know.- Unknown
 Never have truer words been spoken. It is always the unknown unknowns that get you. Because they blind side you when you are looking the other way.
 What gets measured gets managed.- Peter Drucker
 If you want people to focus on something, ask them to measure it. And pop quiz them each day about what the number is. The pop quiz will help:</description>

      <title>Rule 9 - Always start with the end in mind.</title>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination. &amp;ndash; Jimmy Dean
 Always start with the end in mind. What is the ideal outcome? What is your destination? And then breakdown the journey into manageable pieces, reverse engineering the path to get there.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a destination, you don&amp;rsquo;t have direction. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t have direction you are lost, going around and around in circles.</description>

      <title>Rule 8 - Keep one eye open and your ear to the ground.</title>

      <description>Blinding ignorance does mislead us. O! Wretched mortals, open your eyes! - Leonardo da Vinci
 It is easy to focus on your work and for your work to become your world. But it is equally important to keep the bigger picture in mind and maintain perspective. To learn the context of where your work fits into the bigger machine, what external forces could affect your work and how you might be able to help others.</description>

      <title>Rule 7 - Do not walk past it.</title>
      <link>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-7-do-not-walk-past-it/</link>

      <guid>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-7-do-not-walk-past-it/</guid>
      <description>The standard you walk past, is the standard you accept.  - David Morrison
 Be it a safety concern, poor workmanship or bad behaviour if you close your eyes and walk past it then you are accepting it. You are saying that you are not concerned and feel free to keep doing it without correction.
To live by this rule means difficult conversations, extra work and extra responsibility. Not everyone goes looking for or wants these things.</description>

      <description>The 6 Ps: Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance.  - U.S. Army
 Respect the 6 Ps:
 Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance  1 - Prior  Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.  - Abraham Lincoln
 Don&amp;rsquo;t leave your planning to the last moment. Insteed, dive into the detail early to make sure a lack of planning doesn&amp;rsquo;t become somebody else&amp;rsquo;s priority.</description>

      <title>Rule 5 - The early bird catches the worm, and enjoys the fruits of its labor.</title>
      <link>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-5-start-early/</link>

      <guid>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-5-start-early/</guid>
      <description>The early bird catches the worm.  - William Camden
 Always try to start work early because it demonstrates that you want your job and you want to be there. Most things can be taught, enthusiasim and desire, for the most part, cannot be.
Getting to work early gives you the oppurtunity to set the destiny of construction for the day. Otherwise you will be chasing your tail all day, trying to get construction moving in the direction you want.</description>

      <title>Rule 4 - Relationships, say hello because success is largely a result of those around you.</title>

      <description>You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Jim Rohn
 From construction of the project to your career, success — however you measure it — is largely a result of the people around you. So make an effort to build relationships with everyone, from the project director to the members of the workforce. And the best way to build relationships is to say hello and make an effort to learn peoples name.</description>

      <title>Rule 3 - Give me good news, give bad news. Just don&#39;t give me surprises.</title>
      <link>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-3-dont-give-me-surprises/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-3-dont-give-me-surprises/</guid>
      <description>Be in control of your destiny, by getting out in front of issues and avoiding suprises.
 As a manager, I want to know about the good news and the bad news. But don’t bring me surprises. Surprises indicate a lack of understanding and ownership of what you are responsible for.
This rule is no better illustrated then in cost forecasting. If your quantities, rates and costs continually move around.</description>

      <title>Rule 2 - When faced with opposing views, often the answer is both.</title>
      <link>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-2-opposing-views/</link>

      <guid>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-2-opposing-views/</guid>
      <description>Much of life is a dichotomy, a contradiction and construction life is no different.
 When faced with what seem like mutually exclusive and opposing views, often the answer is both. Much of life is a dichotomy, a contradiction and construction life is no different. The skill comes in first realizing this, being comfortable with the contradictions and knowing how to find the balance.
Rule 2, is a little bit of an abstract concept.</description>

      <title>Rule 1 - Your job is to make money. By building it safely, building it once and leaving a positive legacy.</title>
      <link>https://ianteda.com/v2/engineering/rule-1-what-is-your-job/</link>

      <description>Rule 1 - Your job is to make money. By building it safely, building it once and leaving a positive legacy.
 “What do think your job is?”. It is a question I like to ask graduate engineers as they are starting in construction, because it helps to orientate them as they start life in the workforce and start in construction.
What is your job? Your job as a construction engineer is to make money for your employer, XYZ Constructions.</description>
