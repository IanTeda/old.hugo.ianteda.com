#### Forward

Strength is the basis for all movement, injury prevention, recovery and rehabilitation.

In life I try not to live at the extremes. I always set a goals and have a focus, but I try to keep perspective. So as not to go to fare in one direction. With that in mind, I structure my training around the moto: _Strength, flexibility, speed, endurance and health._

This series is a collection of videos, mostly adapted from the book [Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe](http://a.co/8Rrwxg3).
