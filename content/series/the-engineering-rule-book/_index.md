### Forward

A collection of rules, lessons and school boy errors that I have picked up over the years since starting in the civil construction industry in 2003.

They where often taught to me by others and now I hope that can be useful to others.

I have also found that the concepts are also a good starting point for conversations around the topics they explore.

I try not to add fluff, but to get straight to the point.
