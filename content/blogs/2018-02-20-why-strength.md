Fitness is a lot like religion, politics and money. Everybody believes they have the one true, because it has worked for them. However the truth is, you need to find the path that works for you. This means setting goals, experimenting, measuring outcomes, adapting and moving towards your goals each day.

For me, I set a goal of improving my strength. Because __strength is the basis for all movement, injury prevention, recovery and rehabilitation__. And the exercise I have seen the most improvement from has been barbell training, when combined with metabolic exercise and a diet that avoids carbs — any thing that is white or could be white — and replaces it with protein.

I think it is worthwhile to highlight the difference between exercise and training. Exercise doesn't usually have a goal except for getting a sweat up. While training has a specific goal and a program for achieving it.

#### Why barbell training in particular?

Barbell training involves long, complex movements that require balance and large muscle groups. Working your whole body and training your body for movements you find yourself doing in everyday life. Lifting things of the ground, over your head, getting off the ground, pulling yourself up, etc.

Mark Ripetoe, put it well in the opening to his book [Starting Strength](http://a.co/9CWHkFI)

_Physical strength is the most important thing in life. This is true whether we want it to be or not. As humanity has developed throughout history, physical strength has become less critical to our daily existence, but no less important to our lives. Our strength, more than any other thing we possess, still determines the quality and quantity of our time here in these bodies. Whereas previously our physical strength determined how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed, it now merely determines how well we function in these new surrounding we have crafted for ourselves as our culture has accumulated. But we are still animals -- our physical existence is, in the final analysis the only one that actually matters. A week [person] is not as happy as the same [person] would be if he were strong_
