My aim is to workout tomorrow. So I need to workout today in such a way, that tomorrow I am not to sore. This for the most part means not going to failure. But finding the balance between volume and intensity.

Starting out I have found that five sets of five reps has served me well to build up my base strength.

Once you have that base strength and you find that you start to plateau at fives fives. It is time to mix up the programming. I'm not there yet, but the next video is food for thought.
