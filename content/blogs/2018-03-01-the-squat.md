If you are only going to do one exercise, make sure it is the squat. It maybe the most important exercise in the weight room. But is one of the least utilised, because it is the most misunderstood. It involves a complex full range of motion. Making it difficult to learn.

"The Rippetoe Squat" technique has some great cues for learning the squat. The videos outline the cues, but to get better understanding around those cues you cannot go past his book [Starting Strength](http://a.co/9CWHkFI)
