Strength is the basis for all movement, injury prevention, recovery and rehabilitation.

In life I try not to live at the extremes. I always set a goals and have a focus, but I try to keep perspective. So as not to go to fare in one direction. Structuring my training around the moto:

{{< blockquote src="" quote="Strength, flexibility, speed, endurance and health." author="Mark Rippetoe">}}

My primary focus at the moment is to improve my strength. To achieve this I am using the following workout split: 

1. Push Day;
2. Gut (Core) Day;
3. Pull Day;
4. Lift Day;
5. Leg Day;
6. Metabolic Conditioning;

> Previously our physical strength determined how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed, it now merely determines how well we function. Mark Rippetoe

I rotate through the split each morning and do metabolic conditioning exercise at lunch or within the split cycle. With a 5x5 workout with progressive weight increases.

I have adopted a lot from the book Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe. I’m restricted currently because I don’t have a bench or a power rack. So I am doing push ups and cleaning the barbell for squats.

A __Push Workout__ is any exercise where you are pushing. My workout will typically involve a combination of:

* Push UP (Primary);
* Barbell Curls;
* Dips;
* Bench Press

A __Gut Workout__ is any exercise where you are using your posterior chain[^chain] your will typically involve a combination of:

* Kettle Bell Swings (Primary);
* Lower Back Squats;
* Ab Roll Outs;

A __Pull Workout__ will typically involve a combination of:

* Pull Ups (Primary);
* Barbell Rows;

A __Lift Workout__ will typically involve a combination of:

* Overhead Press (Primary);
* Kettle Bell Snatch;

A __Leg Workout__ will typically involve a combination of:
