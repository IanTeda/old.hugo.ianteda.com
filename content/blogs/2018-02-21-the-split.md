I'm currently follow the below workout split. Cycling through a different workout each morning. With around only 40-50 minutes each morning I do what I can. Avoiding stretching and other time wasters. And fitting in metabolic conditioning over lunch when I have a slot or a commute to work.

1. Push Workout;
2. Trunk Workout;
3. Pull Workout;
4. Lift Workout;
5. Leg Workout;
6. Metabolic Conditioning;

I typically do a below target weight warmup set of my primary workout and then move into a [5 set x 5 rep](blogs/the-sets-n-reps/) of my primary and then a secondary workout or combination there off.

I think of a __Push Workout__ is any workout where you are pushing:

* [Push Ups](/blogs/the-push-up/) (Primary);
* [Barbell Curls](/blogs/the-barbell-curl/);
* [Dips](/blogs/the-dip/);
* [Bench Press](/blogs/the-bench-press/)

I think of a __Trunk Workout__ is any workout where you are using your posterior chain[^chain]:

* [Lower Back Squats](/blogs/the-squat/) (Primary);
* [Kettle Bell Swings](/blogs/the-kettlebell-swing/);
* Ab Roll Outs;

I think of a __Pull Workout__ is any workout where you are pulling:

* [Pull Ups](/blogs/the-pull-up/) (Primary);
* [Barbell Rows](/blogs/the-barbell-row/);

I think of a __Lift Workout__ is any workout where you are lifting something above your head:

* [Overhead Press](/blogs/the-overhead-press/) (Primary);
* [Snatch](/blogs/the-snatch/);

I think of a __Leg Workout__ is any workout where you are using your legs and/or lower back:

* [Deed Lifts](/blogs/the-deadlift/) (Primary);
* [Lower Back Squats](/blogs/the-squat/)
* [Power Cleans](/blogs/the-power-clean/)

i think of a __Metabolic Workout__ is any workout where you are pushing into your anaerobic threshold[^threshold]:

* Bike Ride;
* Run;
* Stair Sprints;
* HIIT Circuit;
