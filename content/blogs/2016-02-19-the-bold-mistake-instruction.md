title: The Bold Mistake Instruction
type: blog
description: All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it's impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively.
excerpt: Life is risk, it cannot be avoided so do not let the possibility of being wrong prevent action. An indecision is still a decision. Move forward knowing that the decision you made was the right one, based on the knowledge you had at the time. Whether or not it turns out right is besides the point, considered action is.

Life is risk, it cannot be avoided so do not let the possibility of being wrong prevent action. An indecision is still a decision. Move forward knowing that the decision you made was the right one, based on the knowledge you had at the time. Whether or not it turns out right is besides the point, considered action is.

Becoming successful requires risk and with risk comes mistakes. It is through these mistakes that we learn and grow. We can try to avoid risk but in the end we will make mistakes. However, there are mistakes of sloth and mistakes of ambition. Mistake of sloth lead to missed opportunity and regret. While, mistakes of ambition will be forgiven because they come from good intentions. Mistakes of sloth are not so easily forgiven and often it is ourselves that are the last to forget because regret lives on.

Success for the most part is subjective. Whatever your measure, it still requires action. The path of least resistance is easy because it is well-worn. Be bold, walk the road less traveled and live a life without regrets and full of mistakes.
