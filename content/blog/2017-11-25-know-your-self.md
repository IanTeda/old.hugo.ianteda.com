A letter to my kids,

{{< blockquote src="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-proper-English-Latin-translation-for-know-thyself-be-thyself-love-thyself-in-the-feminine" quote="Nosce te ipsum, tu ipse esto, ama te ipsum. 'know yourself, be yourself, love Yourself'" author="Quora">}}

__Know Yourself__: Step back from the movie being played in your head and examine your habits, your motives and your desires from the outside in. Do they reflect who you want to be, where you want to be, and what your goals and priorities are?  To know yourself is detach from your ego and ask why?

__Be Yourself__: Be aware of your motives, examine your desires and reflect on your actions. Do they reflect who you want to be? Do they reflect the character you want to be? If they do not, then change. If they do, then don't let others change you. There is only one person you need to please and that is yourself.

__Love Yourself__: You will never be able to love others and others will find it hard to love you, if you first do not love yourself. To love yourself is to be proud and confident in who you are. Ask yourself am I proud of what I'm about to do? If not, don't do it.

Do your habits reflect your goals, does your character reflect the person you want to be, do you love yourself and the person you are.  If not, take action. Because if you do not master your life, life will master you and pass you by.
