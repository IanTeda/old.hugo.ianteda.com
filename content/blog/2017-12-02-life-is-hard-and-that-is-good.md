A letter to my kids,

Life is not all sun shine, unicorns and rainbows. Life is hard, it is meant to be hard and that is good!

It is good because, it is through struggle and adversity that we grow and learn. And it is with a measure of difficulty that value is assigned.

You don't really know who you are, your true character, without struggle. If it was not for struggle, we would all be the same. It is what molds us. We don't know what we are capable of unless we are pushed past our boundaries. And it is often as a result of adversity, the lessons we had to learn ourselves, that we grow. It teaches us to be humble and to feel empathy to others and their struggles.

Things that are easy are off little value, things that are hard are invaluable. Because they are rare, rarely done, and rarely obtained. So seek out the hard things, because that is were the most value is. But remember that every thing has a price, a trade off and that suffering is the price you will pay. Not just personally but others around you. So ask yourself, are you willing to pay the price for what you want?

Keep in mind that things are the hardest, the worst, right before they get better. That there is always going to be set backs. And that life is full of ups and downs. So keep focused on growing. Travel upstream against the current and don't meander downstream. 

Let failure be a surprise.
