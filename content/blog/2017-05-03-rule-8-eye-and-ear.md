It is easy to focus on your work and for your work to become your world. But it is equally important to keep the bigger picture in mind and maintain perspective. To learn the context of where your work fits into the bigger machine, what external forces could affect your work and how you might be able to help others.

With that in mind, take the long slow way around site. Keeping one eye open, observing what others are doing. And your ear to the ground, listening to what others are saying in meetings and in conversation.

By doing this you are able to answer more questions, know the right person to ask your question to and where to find that stock N16 bar when you under order.
