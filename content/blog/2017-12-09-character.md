A letter to my children,

{{< blockquote src="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/h_jackson_brown_jr_101336?src=t_character" quote="Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking." author="H. Jackson Brown, Jr.">}}

Your character is essentially what you do, your actions. And the best reflection of your character is the way you behave when nobody else is looking. When peer pressure and the need to confirm to the tribe does not influence your actions. That is to say that your character is essentially the collective of your habits. It is the small things that you do everyday.

To work on your character, is the work on your habits. A habit is your learned behaviour to an event. Know your self, know your habits.

Good character is essentially doing what is right. Trusting a person, is trusting there character to do what is right. Even when it is not easy and may affect then personally.

Be conscious of who your friends are. There character. As birds of a feather, flock together. Your are most comfortable around people like you. But that may not be the character you want to be. You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Choose your friends wisely.

> The best index to a person's character is how he treats people who can't do him any good, and how he treats people who can't fight back.â€• Abigail Van Buren.
