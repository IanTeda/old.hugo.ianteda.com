      <description>A pull up should be thought of as a row. Making the row a great supporting exercise for the pull up.

      <description>Great overall trunk workout. Using a lot of the same body movements as the squat.
I use them as volume/metabolic building workout to compliment the squat.

      <description>If you are only going to do one exercise, make sure it is the squat. It maybe the most important exercise in the weight room. But is one of the least utilised, because it is the most misunderstood. It involves a complex full range of motion.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have a bench to press from, so I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing push ups as my primary push exercise. You will also find that the bench press is becoming less of bench mark for strength &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;how much can you bench bro&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing many dips, because I do not have the equipment. Dips can be progressed with weighted belts.

      <description>In life you will not find yourself having to do movements similar to the curl very often. And so, the curl doesn&amp;rsquo;t add much to your over body strength. But who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to have bigger guns. So we all do them.

      <title>The Push Up</title>

      <description>Push ups are similar to the bench press, using similar upper body muscles. They have the advantage of using more muscle mass and joints then the bench press. But have the the disadvantage of being harder to progress &amp;ndash; i.e. add weight.
Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a bench to press from.</description>

      <description>My aim is to workout tomorrow. So I need to workout today in such a way, that tomorrow I am not to sore. This for the most part means not going to failure. But finding the balance between volume and intensity.
Starting out I have found that five sets of five reps has served me well to build up my base strength.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently follow the below workout split. Cycling through a different workout each morning. With around only 40-50 minutes each morning I do what I can. Avoiding stretching and other time wasters. And fitting in metabolic conditioning over lunch when I have a slot or a commute to work.</description>

      <description>Fitness is a lot like religion, politics and money. Everybody believes they have the one true, because it has worked for them. However the truth is, you need to find the path that works for you. This means setting goals, experimenting, measuring outcomes, adapting and moving towards your goals each day.</description>
