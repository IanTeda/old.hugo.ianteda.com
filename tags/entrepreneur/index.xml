      <description>&amp;ldquo;Daring ideas are like chessmen moved forward. They may be beaten, but they may start a winning game.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ndash; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
 Ideas are easy, cheap even. It is the execution that is hard and because it is hard it is worth millions. If the execution wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard everyone would be doing it. And if everyone was doing it, then it would be worthless and quickly become a race to the bottom.</description>
