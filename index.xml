      <description>On the subject of money,
Keep in mind that money is a lot like religion, politics and health. People believe they have the one truth and they will defend it passionately. But there are many paths, you need to find the one that best fits your character, appetite for risk and time.</description>

      <description>On the subject of character,
The best index to a person&amp;#39;s character is how he treats people who can&amp;#39;t do him any good, and how he treats people who can&amp;#39;t fight back.
Abigail Van Buren  Your character is essentially what you do, your actions. And your actions are largely a result of your habits.</description>

      <description>Simply put, Hugo is way faster than Jekyll at building your site after pushing edits &amp;amp; commits.
Quora  My Jekyll build time was quickly growing and I was finding myself having to fix dependencies every time I felt the need to update Jekyll. I was getting frustrated, having to fight Jekyll when I wanted to be creating content.</description>

      <description>With great power comes great responsibility.
Uncle Ben  Collections of information get abstracted away into what we call professions. Doctors, lawyers, electricians, engineers, etc. It isn’t possible for each of us to know everything, so we rely on professions. And we rely on professionals to understand that information.</description>

      <description>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
Leonardo da Vinci  Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS).
It isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to make things difficult, anybody can do that. Even someone stupid. The skill and art, is in making it simple.
Simple is: the essence; the most important part; something that is repeatable; provides the same outcome; that if you remember anything, remember this;</description>

      <description>Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same.
The Fray - All at Once  Anything worthwhile is hard. Because it is the difficulties that make it unique and it is the uniqueness that makes it valuable.

      <description>Time is the measurer of all things, but is itself immeasurable, and the grand discloser of all things, but is itself undisclosed.
Charles Caleb Colton  It all boils down to time. After all, money is just the value we place on time. It makes sense then, that the most valuable gift you can give is your time.</description>

      <description>You don&amp;#39;t know, what you don&amp;#39;t know.
Unknown  Never have truer words been spoken. It is always the unknown unknowns that get you. Because they blind side you when you are looking the other way.
What gets measured gets managed.
Peter Drucker  If you want people to focus on something, ask them to measure it.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#39;t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.
Jimmy Dean  Always start with the end in mind. What is the ideal outcome? What is your destination? And then breakdown the journey into manageable pieces, reverse engineering the path to get there.</description>

David Morrison  Be it a safety concern, poor workmanship or bad behaviour if you close your eyes and walk past it then you are accepting it. You are saying that you are not concerned and feel free to keep doing it without correction.</description>

      <description>The early bird catches the worm.
William Camden  Always try to start work early because it demonstrates that you want your job and you want to be there. Most things can be taught, enthusiasm and desire, for the most part, cannot be.
Getting to work early gives you the opportunity to set the destiny of construction for the day.</description>

      <description>You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.
Jim Rohn  From construction of the project to your career, success — however you measure it — is largely a result of the people around you. So make an effort to build relationships with everyone, from the project director to the members of the workforce.</description>

      <description>Be in control of your destiny, by getting out in front of issues and avoiding surprises.
 As a manager, I want to know about the good news and the bad news. But don’t bring me surprises. Surprises indicate a lack of understanding and ownership of what you are responsible for.</description>

      <description>Much of life is a dichotomy, a contradiction and construction life is no different.
 When faced with what seem like mutually exclusive and opposing views, often the answer is both. Much of life is a dichotomy, a contradiction and construction life is no different. The skill comes in first realizing this, being comfortable with the contradictions and knowing how to find the balance.</description>

      <description>Rule 1 - Your job is to make money. By building it safely, building it once and leaving a positive legacy.
 “What do think your job is?”. It is a question I like to ask graduate engineers as they are starting in construction, because it helps to orientate them as they start life in the workforce and start in construction.</description>

      <description>All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it&amp;#39;s impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.

      <description>Live, love, be generous, show respect and give thanks.
Know who you are and remember were you came from, but always look forward to were you are going.
Time is the most valuable thing you have, as death comes to us all. So spend it wisely and without regrets.</description>
